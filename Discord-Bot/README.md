# Part 3 - R&D (Research & Documentation)

- Setup
	- The packages needed to run the project python3, python3-pip, python-dotenv, and discord.py==2.0.1.
	- To get the API token, go into the Bot page on the Developer Portal and click to generate a token and copy it. 
	- The API token must to be put into a .env file in the same folder as the the python code file for the project to run.
- Usage 	
	- The command you can type into Discord is 'Cavs'.
	- The responses are the following:
		- 'The Cleveland Cavaliers currently have 4 All-Stars on their roster.'
		- 'It has been reported by Brian Windhorst that Donovan Mitchell is excited with the prospect of playing with Darius Garland.'
        	- 'There is still room for improvement if the Cavs do not sign or trade for a 3&D wing.'
      		- 'The Cleveland Cavaliers still have one more roster spot left, as it is knwon that they are trying out a few players.'
      		- 'Ricky Rubio had so much faith in the Cavaliers, that he resigned on a smaller contract after being traded.'
- Research
	- One solution is to have a private server in which the script can always be running and listening to the chat in Discord.
	- Another solution is to just run the script on a completely diffferent computer, one that can stay on at all times, albeit something that takes less power and hardware.
		- Example: a Rasberry Pi.
